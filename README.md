Electron Media Server
=====================

A GUI media server which accepts remote requests to alter host system's media configurations.
(Media control works with OS X only at the moment).

## Building & Running

1. Clone and cd into the repo.
2. Install all the dependencies with `npm i`
3. Run the GUI server with `npm start`

## Generating Executables

To generate OS X *.app executable file, run `npm run pack`. A new directory `Electron-Media-Server`
would be created with the executables in it.
